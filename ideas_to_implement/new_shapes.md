1. More Regular Polygons
You already have 3–6 sides covered; adding more could allow for patterns that feel more “tiling-like” or mandala-like:

- Octagon (8 sides) — great for symmetric, radial compositions.
- Heptagon (7 sides) — slightly asymmetrical feel compared to hexagon/octagon.
- Nonagon (9 sides) — nice when combined with rotation animations.

2. Curved / Organic Shapes
These can make your generative art look less rigid:

- Ellipse — a stretched circle; rotation makes it feel dynamic.
- Arc / Semi-Circle — partial curves work beautifully in repetitive patterns.
- Leaf Shape — two mirrored arcs meeting at sharp tips.

3. Complex Geometric Stars
You have a 5-point star — but variations can really spice things up:

- 6, 7, or 8-point stars — by alternating inner/outer radii in the same pattern you used.
- Spirograph-like stars — computed from sine/cosine with more complex frequency ratios.

4. Crosses & Plus Signs
Minimalist but striking when repeated:

- Cross / X-shape — can be rotated in interesting ways.
- “Asterisk” — a star made from straight lines instead of polygons.


5. Fractal / Iterative Shapes
These are great for generative, especially with variable recursion depth:

- ✅ Koch Snowflake — fractal triangle-based snowflake.
- Sierpinski Triangle — hollow, recursive triangles.
- Fractal Tree — if you want organic growth patterns.

6. Pattern & Optical Illusion Shapes
Shapes that play tricks on the eye:

- Polygon with inner cut-out — e.g., hexagon ring.
- Concentric circles / polygons — repeating, shrinking versions.
- ✅ Yin-Yang style curves.

7. Parametric / Wavy Shapes
Using sinusoidal variation in radius:

- Flower / Petal Shapes — r(θ) = base + sin(kθ) * amplitude.
- Gear Shapes — like a circle but with teeth.
