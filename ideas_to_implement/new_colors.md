# Color schemes

## High-contrast & striking

- Triadic → three equally spaced hues (e.g., cyan–magenta–yellow).
- Split-complementary → a base color + the two colors adjacent to its complement.
- ✅ Duotone + Accent → two main colors and a single pop color appearing rarely.
- ✅ Infrared / Thermal camera → deep blue → green → yellow → red → white.

## Mood-based themes

- ✅ Cyberpunk → neon magenta, cyan, and deep purple. 
- ✅ Sunset → warm yellow → orange → pink → purple gradient.
- ✅ Aurora Borealis → teal → green → purple with soft blending.
- ✅ Desert → sandy beige, warm oranges, muted browns.

## Texture & subtle contrast

- Earthy tones → muted greens, browns, ochres.
- Muted pastel rainbow → same hue spread as rainbow, but low saturation.
- ✅ Metallics → gold, silver, bronze gradients.

## Playful & abstract

- ✅ Pop art → bright primaries with sharp black/white outlines.
- ✅ Vaporwave → lavender, cyan, peach, pink.
- ✅ Candy shop → bubblegum pink, mint green, lemon yellow.

## Experimental

- Noise-based palette → Perlin/Simplex noise for hue variation.
- Golden ratio hue rotation → hue offset by 0.618 each step for non-repeating sequences.
- Checkerboard gradient → alternating two gradients in a grid pattern.
