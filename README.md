# 🎨 Distorsion Movement - Interactive Generative Art Engine

**Distorsion Movement** is a real-time generative art platform that creates mesmerizing visual experiences through geometrically deformed grids. The system generates dynamic, interactive artwork by applying mathematical distortions to regular grids of multiple geometric shapes (squares, circles, triangles, hexagons, pentagons, stars, diamonds) with variable grid densities and comprehensive scene management capabilities

## 🎯 Project Overview

### What It Does
The project creates animated grids of geometric shapes where each shape can be:
- **Multiple shape types** including squares, circles, triangles, hexagons, pentagons, stars, diamonds, and fractal Koch snowflakes
- **Geometrically distorted** using 20 mathematical functions (sine waves, Perlin noise, circular patterns, spiral warps, lens effects, moiré patterns, etc.)
- **Dynamically colored** using 20 schemes (rainbow, gradient, neon, cyberpunk, thermal, vaporwave, etc.)
- **Dynamically resized** with variable grid densities from 8×8 to 256×256 cells
- **Interactively controlled** through comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and real-time parameter adjustment
- **Mixed or uniform** shape distribution across the grid
- **Saved and loaded** as complete scene configurations with all parameters preserved
- **Recorded as GIFs** for sharing animated sequences

### How It Works Technically

The core architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Grid Generation**: Creates a regular NxN grid of geometric shapes with base positions and dynamic density control
2. **Shape System**: Supports 8 different shape types with unified rendering architecture
3. **Distortion Engine**: Applies mathematical transformations to deform shape positions and orientations
4. **Color System**: Generates dynamic colors based on position, time, and color animation input
5. **Scene Management**: Complete parameter serialization/deserialization with YAML persistence
6. **Media Export**: Real-time GIF recording and PNG screenshot capabilities
7. **Status Monitoring**: Live parameter display and interactive help system
8. **Rendering**: Real-time pygame-based visualization with 60fps target

### Mathematical Foundation

The distortions are based on several mathematical approaches:
- **Sine Wave Distortions**: `sin(x * frequency + phase) * amplitude`
- **Perlin Noise**: Smooth, organic-looking deformations
- **Circular Distortions**: Radial distortions from center points
- **Swirl Distortions**: Rotational vortex effects around the canvas center
- **Ripple Distortions**: Concentric waves with tangential displacement
- **Flow Distortions**: Curl-noise vector fields for organic movement
- **Random Static**: Controlled randomness for chaotic effects

### How does a distorsion function work ?

**Global Principle**: A distortion function is a mathematical transformation that takes static grid positions and creates smooth, organic movement by calculating new positions and rotations for each element over time.

**Input Parameters**:
- `base_pos` - Original static position (x, y) of a grid element
- `params` - Unique parameters per cell (phase offsets, frequencies) for variety
- `cell_size` - Grid cell size for appropriate movement scaling
- `distortion_strength` - Global intensity multiplier (0.0 = no effect, 1.0 = full effect)
- `time` - Current animation time (key ingredient for smooth motion)
- `canvas_size` - Canvas dimensions for center-based effects

**Output**: `(new_x, new_y, rotation)` - The displaced position and rotation angle where the element should be drawn.

**Animation Mechanics**: The system runs at **60 FPS**, meaning every square is recalculated and redrawn 60 times per second. Small time increments combined with continuous mathematical functions (sine, cosine, etc.) create the illusion of fluid movement. Each frame, the `time` parameter increases slightly, producing smooth positional changes that your eye perceives as organic motion rather than discrete jumps.
