1. Spiral Warp ✅
Idea: Move points along a spiral path from the center (like a galaxy formation), with radius slowly increasing or decreasing over time.

Effect: Creates a vortex-like rotation that feels more “orderly” than a chaotic swirl.

2. Shear / Skew Distortion ✅
Idea: Apply a horizontal or vertical shear based on the y or x coordinate and time.

Effect: Produces a wave-like diagonal stretching, like a deck of cards being pushed sideways.

3. Pulse / Breathing ✅
Idea: Scale positions radially from the center in and out over time, like a heartbeat or breathing motion.

Effect: Everything expands and contracts together, very hypnotic.

4. Fractal Noise Warp ✅
Idea: Like your Perlin distortion, but layered with multiple octaves of noise, each affecting position at different scales.

Effect: Creates more “organic” terrain-like distortions with both large and small deformations mixed.

5. Lens / Magnify Effect ✅
Idea: Pick a moving “focus point” and distort nearby cells outward (like magnification) while compressing farther areas.

Effect: Feels like dragging a magnifying glass over the grid.

6. Curl Warp (full) ✅
Idea: Use proper curl noise to create smooth swirling vector fields with no divergence.

Effect: Flow-like, but with more chaotic patterns that loop back on themselves.

7. Checkerboard Warp ✅
Idea: Alternate distortion directions based on grid coordinates (e.g., even cells move right, odd cells move left).

Effect: Creates a “tug-of-war” effect across the grid.

7. Checkerboard Warp Diagonal ✅
Idea: Alternate distortion directions based on grid coordinates (e.g., even cells move right, odd cells move left).

Effect: Creates a “tug-of-war” effect across the grid.

8. Tornado Column ✅
Idea: Swirl effect, but rotation speed increases as you get closer to the center axis (like a tornado).

Effect: Strong dynamic pull inward while spinning.

9. Spiral Wave ✅
Idea: Combination of circular ripple + swirl, so waves travel outward while rotating.

Effect: Looks like a ripple on water but twisted.

10. Noise-driven Rotation ✅
Idea: Position stays mostly the same, but rotation of each cell is controlled entirely by noise or sine patterns.

Effect: Gives a shimmering/morphing appearance.

# More pschychelic ideas

1. Moiré Warp
Idea: Use overlapping wave patterns with slightly different frequencies on X and Y to create interference patterns.

Effect: Hypnotic shimmering grids that look like optical illusions when animated.

Twist: Slight phase drift over time makes the patterns morph constantly.

2. Kaleidoscope Twist
Idea: Mirror and rotate cells around the center in repeating wedge-shaped sectors (like a kaleidoscope).

Effect: Radial symmetry that constantly shifts and folds in on itself.

Twist: Combine with small Perlin displacement for “melting symmetry”.

3. Chromatic Aberration Warp
Idea: Offset three layers of the grid (representing R, G, B channels) in slightly different directions based on position + time.

Effect: Edges split into rainbow fringes that shift over time.

Twist: Vary offsets radially for a “sunburst” prism look.

4. Hypno Spiral Pulse
Idea: Spiral Warp + Pulse, but the pulse affects angle instead of radius.

Effect: Feels like the entire spiral is breathing and twisting at the same time, pulling you in.

Twist: Reverse spin halfway through the pulse cycle for a trippy “flip” effect.

5. Inversion Bubble
Idea: Pick random moving points, and inside their radius, invert displacements (everything looks like it’s folding inside-out).

Effect: Bubbles of reality flipping over themselves that float across the grid.

Twist: Fade them in/out for smooth morphing between normal and inverted states.

6. Radial Frequency Sweep
Idea: A radial sine wave, but its frequency changes over time, so rings appear to be expanding and contracting at different rates.

Effect: Feels like sound waves visualized on water.

Twist: Modulate rotation with the frequency sweep so rings “wobble” while expanding.

7. Optical Tunnel
Idea: Everything moves along curved paths toward the center while scaling down, like falling into an infinite tunnel.

Effect: Gives a “whoosh” warp sensation.

Twist: Offset the tunnel center in a slow circle to make it feel like a vortex drifting.

8. Plasma Warp
Idea: Use two animated 2D noise fields (like clouds) to distort both position and rotation.

Effect: Everything looks like it’s made of molten lava or plasma waves.

Twist: Blend noise layers at different speeds for constant unpredictable motion.

9. Checkerboard Phase Flip
Idea: Like Checkerboard Warp, but instead of moving, cells rotate 180° in alternating patterns, and flip back in sync with a beat.

Effect: Creates a flashing, tessellated optical illusion.

Twist: Randomly shift the checkerboard grid over time so the flipping pattern morphs.

10. Dimensional Shift
Idea: Periodically collapse the grid toward a single axis, then let it spring back.

Effect: Looks like the 2D world is being “folded” into 1D and then popping back into shape.

Twist: Rotate the folding axis slowly so it sweeps across the scene.
