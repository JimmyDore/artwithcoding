1. Spiral Warp ✅
Idea: Move points along a spiral path from the center (like a galaxy formation), with radius slowly increasing or decreasing over time.

Effect: Creates a vortex-like rotation that feels more “orderly” than a chaotic swirl.

2. Shear / Skew Distortion ✅
Idea: Apply a horizontal or vertical shear based on the y or x coordinate and time.

Effect: Produces a wave-like diagonal stretching, like a deck of cards being pushed sideways.

3. Pulse / Breathing ✅
Idea: Scale positions radially from the center in and out over time, like a heartbeat or breathing motion.

Effect: Everything expands and contracts together, very hypnotic.

4. Fractal Noise Warp
Idea: Like your Perlin distortion, but layered with multiple octaves of noise, each affecting position at different scales.

Effect: Creates more “organic” terrain-like distortions with both large and small deformations mixed.

5. Lens / Magnify Effect ✅
Idea: Pick a moving “focus point” and distort nearby cells outward (like magnification) while compressing farther areas.

Effect: Feels like dragging a magnifying glass over the grid.

6. Curl Warp (full)
Idea: Use proper curl noise to create smooth swirling vector fields with no divergence.

Effect: Flow-like, but with more chaotic patterns that loop back on themselves.

7. Checkerboard Warp ✅
Idea: Alternate distortion directions based on grid coordinates (e.g., even cells move right, odd cells move left).

Effect: Creates a “tug-of-war” effect across the grid.

7. Checkerboard Warp Diagonal ✅
Idea: Alternate distortion directions based on grid coordinates (e.g., even cells move right, odd cells move left).

Effect: Creates a “tug-of-war” effect across the grid.

8. Tornado Column ✅
Idea: Swirl effect, but rotation speed increases as you get closer to the center axis (like a tornado).

Effect: Strong dynamic pull inward while spinning.

9. Spiral Wave ✅
Idea: Combination of circular ripple + swirl, so waves travel outward while rotating.

Effect: Looks like a ripple on water but twisted.

10. Noise-driven Rotation ✅
Idea: Position stays mostly the same, but rotation of each cell is controlled entirely by noise or sine patterns.

Effect: Gives a shimmering/morphing appearance.
